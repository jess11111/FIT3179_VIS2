        The dataset provided by Tony Pino on Kaggle contain information about Melbourne housing market clearance 
        from Jan 2016 to Aug 2018.

        This visualisation zooms in on the council areas surronding Melbourne's CBD (see chart axis below),
        and allows you to take a closer look at the factors influencing property prices, namely, the 
        <span class='houses_text'> houses </span>, <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span> 
        and <span class='units_text'>units</span> whose relating information (e.g. building area) 
        have been adequately provided. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        What type of property would most suit you? 
        Which region offers you the best (or worst) buying solution based on your budget?
        Lastly, based on recent data, during what times of the year should you make the purchase?
        Upon examination of the following visualisation, answers to these questions may be made a little clearer.

        The left-most chart shows some of the most and least sought after and populated council areas around metropolitan Melbourne.
        If you're on a budget, a house or <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span>
         in Brimbank, or an <span class='units_text'>units</span>
         in Maribyrnong may be most suitable. 
         <span class='units_text'>units</span> in Monash, contratsingly, 
         appears to be very expensive when compared to other councils. 
        If you're afer one, make sure to keep an eye out because they are also scarcely sold!

        3-4 bedroom houses were most frequently bought. 
        As expected, residential property buyers are mostly those who are looking to live with others.  
        If you're after a 5+ bedroom property, a house may be your only option.

        Once you've considered the property type... let's look closer at WHERE exactly you should buy.

        ← Distribution of properties sold that have a good <strong> investment property 
        land-building ratio </strong> of approx. 4:6. <br> 
        40% of land can help maximise investment capital and the potential for higher equity growth in the long-term. 
        60% of building area remains an appropriate size for possible rental attraction.
        We consider the ratio as buildings can be continuously renovated whilst land is fixed. 
        Properties sold that satisfy the ratio appear more densely concentrated in the metropolitan North.
        <br> 
         <br> 
        The <strong> price of properties relative to the number of bedrooms they have </strong> shows 
        suburbs that are just outside the CBD, such as Toorak and Canterbury, as the most expensive. 
        An additional ~20 km away from these suburbs, average prices become 2-3 times cheaper. →

        <div class="absolute4">
            ← The map shows the spatial distribution of <strong>sold property building ages</strong>. 
            The oldest building are concentarted in inner city suburbs such as Fitzroy, Middle Park 
            and Kingsville. 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            A buyer tends to receive less land for each dollar paid when the property is situated 
            closer to the CBD 
            (a square meter of land becomes more expensive). 
            In particular, this distance is more influential on sale price than land size -
            meaning that when considering a property that either has large land or is closer to the city centre, 
            you will find the former option to be more economical. 
            <br> 
            Occasionally, you will find <span class='units_text'>units</span> near the CBD 
            that sell for a comparably cheaper price. →

            On average, sales are lower at the beginnging of the year and 
            gradually increase throughout the months. There evern appears to be
            an inverse relationship between <span class='units_text'>units</span>
             and <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span>
            - e.g. 
            as prices for <span class='units_text'>units</span> increase, 
            we see <span class='townhouses_text'> townhouses </span> 
            prices go up for that month. 
            
            Although houses seem like the most costly type of property to purchase, townhouses 
            are in fact more expensive for every square meter whilst also showing the most 
            fluctuations.
